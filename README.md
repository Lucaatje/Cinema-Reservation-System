# Cinema Reservation System

This is one of my first major school projects duing my study Computer Science. It's an console-based cinema reservation application, mostly developed with C# that connects to a external SQL database. This project was created as part of a team assigment to learn the basics of object-oriented programming, database interaction and using Git for version control

The application allows users to view all available movies and select a screening. Users can choose a time slot, select one or more seats, and make a reservation. Additionally, they can pick an auditorium based on their preferences, such as size (number of seats). All user data and reservations are stored in an external SQL Server database.
Besides standard users, the application also supports admin access. Admins have extended permissions to manage user profiles, reservations, movies, and screenings. Users can also view the cinema's catering menu and house rules via the application.

This application is written in C# as a .NET Console application. It stores its data in Microsoft SQL Server and was developed in Visual Studio with Git and GitHub for version control.

Within our team, I played a key role in structuring the overall layout of the console application. I was mainly responsible for developing the reservation and movie schedule section, including movie selection and creating movie schedules. I also played a part in the account registration system.

Through this project, I developed a solid foundation in object-oriented programming and became more confident working with real database systems. I learned how to design clean, maintainable code and gained experience in solving practical problems as part of a team. 
In addition to improving my technical skills, I also grew in soft skills such as team communication, collaboration and working towards shared goals under deadlines. This project taught me the value of code structure, planning ahead, and supporting each other to deliver a functional application.
